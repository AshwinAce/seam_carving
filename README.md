# seam_carving
This is a repository where I execute seam carving on an image.
Seam carving is a technique used for resizing images without losing imoortant information. This is done by removing "seams" of pixels which when removed have the least impact. This is usually measured by using pixel intensity differnces among neighboring pixels.
